# Python-Challenge

This challenge looks at 2 different files: PyBank and PyPoll.
PyBank is financial data that has code inserted to produce a basic financial analysis.
PyPoll is a list of election votes that has code inserted to produce election results.

Both files will produce a .txt file that is saved in the analysis folder, and print the analysis to the terminal. 

The financial analysis is expected to show the following information:
  -Total months
  -Total profits
  -Average change in profits/losses
  -Greatest increase in profits
  -Greatest decrease in profits
  
The election results are expected to produce the following information:
  -Total votes
  -List of candidates
  -Percentage of votes acquired by each candidate
  -Total votes acquired by each candidate as well as vote percentage
  -Winner of the vote based on total votes


The financial analysis did not yield the expected average change in profits/losses, despite multiple code alterations. Otherwise, both codes are successful in every other aspect.
